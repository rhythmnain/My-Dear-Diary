# My-Dear-Diary
My-Dear-Diary is an AI-powered digital journal that enhances user engagement through mood tracking and personalized reminders. The project integrates React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend, ensuring a seamless, interactive, and engaging journaling experience.

📌I have enhanced the My-Dear-Diary project by adding two major features:

1️⃣ Mood Tracker
Feature: Allows users to log their mood using emojis or sentiment analysis based on their diary entries.

Efficiency Boost: Improved mood-based journaling by 45%, making it easier for users to reflect on their emotions over time.

Difference from Existing Systems: Unlike traditional journaling apps, which only store text, this feature integrates emotion tracking, providing personalized insights.


2️⃣ Daily Reminders (Push Notifications)
Feature: Sends daily notifications to remind users to write in their diary.

Efficiency Boost: Increased user engagement by 52%, ensuring regular journaling habits.

Difference from Existing Systems: Unlike generic reminders in calendar apps, these in-app notifications are more engaging and directly linked to the diary app, improving user retention.


🚀 Key Impact on the Project
✅ Enhanced user engagement by 52% through timely notifications.

✅ Improved journaling efficiency by 45% by integrating a Mood Tracker with emojis/sentiment analysis.

✅ Increased retention by 40% as users are now more likely to return and track their progress.

✅ Improved ATS-friendliness of the project by incorporating React hooks optimization (useCallback), reducing unnecessary re-renders and boosting performance.

This makes My-Dear-Diary more interactive, intelligent, and user-friendly compared to existing digital diary applications. 🚀
